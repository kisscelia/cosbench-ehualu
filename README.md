COSBench - Cloud Object Storage Benchmark
=========================================

COSBench is a benchmarking tool to measure the performance of Cloud Object Storage services. Object storage is an
emerging technology that is different from traditional file systems (e.g., NFS) or block device systems (e.g., iSCSI).
Amazon S3 and Openstack* swift are well-known object storage solutions.

COSBench now supports SineIO*, OpenStack* Swift, Amazon* S3, OpenIO*, Amplidata v2.3, 2.5 and 3.1, Scality*, Ceph, CDMI, Google* Cloud Storage, Aliyun OSS as well as custom adaptors.

## Announcement

Because of [In Maintenance Mode as of July 31, 2024](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java?tab=readme-ov-file#in-maintenance-mode-as-of-july-31-2024) and [End-of-Support on December 31, 2025](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java?tab=readme-ov-file#end-of-support-on-december-31-2025), so the milestone version of cosbench-sineio (v0.6.0.0 released at 2024.8.31) changed as follows:

1. sio renamed to siov1, and will not be maintained.
2. siov2 renamed to sio, as a LTS Storage.


LTS
----------------------------------------
- AWS SDK version will be updated monthly for SineIO if needed.

COSBench Storages Comparision
----------------------------------------

> 1. SineIO is S3 storage and hardware can be 'fullstack' (NVMe, SSD, HDD, Tape, Disc, etc.)
> 2. sio and siov1: Usage, please refer to conf/sio-config-sample.xml
